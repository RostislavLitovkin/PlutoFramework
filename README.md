# PlutoWallet
A sample wallet that implements [Plutonication](https://github.com/cisar2218/Plutonication).

Supported platforms:
- Android & WearOS
- iOS & ipadOS
- MacCatalyst
- Windows

The wallet supports these functionalities:
- generating Mnemonics & creating a privateKey
- showing and sharing your public key and ss58 key
- connecting to any substrate based blockchain/parachain
- getting your actual balance
- simple transfer
- calling any pallet functions

3rd party integrations:
- [Calamar explorer](https://github.com/topmonks/calamar)


# [PlutoConnector](https://github.com/cisar2218/Plutonication)
Allows any dApp to communicate with supported wallets without compromising private keys. It was designed for a specific purpose, but can also be used for general solutions that need to achieve a level of abstraction with TCP communication.

# Terminology
- dApp = any application that wants to use the crypto functionalities. In order to use dApps, it needs to communicate with the crypto wallet somehow, or it needs to know your private key (very insecure).

# Work / milestones

### part 1 - Plutonication (Pluto connector)
> **Note for development:** to update git submodule, run: `git submodule update --remote`
0) [-] Create a simple dApp to test the connection between the Wallet and dApp.
1) [x] Find out how to connect the 2 apps via WebSocket (look into resources) - solved via TCP protocol.
2) [x] Create the 2 basic call operations/methods:
  - SendMessage(PlutoMessage{Code, Data}) 
  - ReceiveMessage(PlutoMessage{Code, Data})
    - where code is ID which determinate type of message. Data are content of message.
3) [x] Make this a modular package -> release to Nuget.
4) [X] Class with URI link (containing IP address, port, and authentication token).
  - Also allow parameters: Name (dApp name), Icon (URL to dApp icon). These two params may help identify the nature of the incoming transaction when scanning QR code.
  - QR code generation will probably be part of PlutoWallet.
6) [X] Convert to async.
7) [X] Create safe listen+connection.
  - Wallet (client): `Connect(ipAddress, port, auth)`, dApp (server): `StartServer(port, auth)`
  - Listen will compare received `auth` with held `auth`. If match: OK, else: don't match -> kick.
8) [X] create client which handles infinite receive loop completely. Event driven architecture:
  - Start (Connect/Listen), which will pair automatically using given credentials and set up a loop that will receive messages (until CloseConnection is called).
  - Include Recv. message event.
  - ConnectionClosed event.
  - ConnectionEstablished event.
9) [ ] Experimental object class sending including object serialization (Status: deserialization is unreliable. May work on this feature in the future. May use a totally different approach. See the issue [here](https://github.com/cisar2218/Plutonication/issues/6), branch here)

15) [X] nuget package
16) [ ] ip address on android devices
50) [ ] (VERY IMPORTANT) create a very detailed (and begginer friendly) documentation with how to use it and add examples

101) [ ] polkadot js integration (ask Ros≈•a for more)

102) [ ] make a javascript version

##### Usecases
1. pair devices
2. send publickey to wallet (string)
3. send transaction <"header",byte, byte, byte[]> from dApp to wallet:
  - wallet y/n -> response (failed due sth/rejected/accepted <enum>)
  - dApp: display status of transaction (response)
4. both wallet and dApp are able to send data in form of:
  - `byte[]` byte array
  - `string`
  - alone `MessageCode` enum (can be used for example to send confirmation with `MesageCode.Success`, `MessageCode.Refused`, `MessageCode.FilledOut`)
4. close connection (from both sides):
 - on connection lost event
 - throws exceptions in proper cases/places

##### QR code docs (format):
1) Starts with ``` plutonication: ```
2) Query parameters:
  - url = dApp url to connect to (with port),
    example: ``` url=192.168.0.1:1234 ```
   - key  = password key to connect,
    example: ``` key=password123 ```
  - name (optional) = dApp name,
    example: ``` name=Galaxy logic game ```
  - icon (optional) = dApp icon url
    example: ``` icon=http://rostislavlitovkin.pythonanywhere.com/logo ```

A complete example: ``` plutonication:?url=192.168.0.1:8000&key=password123&name=Galaxy logic game&icon=http://rostislavlitovkin.pythonanywhere.com/logo ```

### part 2 - PlutoWallet
1) [x] generate mnemonics and show it to the user
1) [ ] enter mnemonics
1) [ ] enter private key
1) [ ] show the user raw privateKey
2) [ ] save the privateKey securely (probably always ask for password)
3) [ ] (extra) secure with password/biometrics
4) [x] generate a publicKey from the privateKey
5) [x] (extra - EASY) make ss58 encoded publicKeys
6) [x] get the current balance
7) [ ] (extra) show the balance in USD (use coingecko free api)
8) [x] add a transfer functionality
9) [ ] add the ability to sign any transaction
10) [ ] implement the PlutoConnect link (a specialized link that will open PlutoWallet app and pass in all the info needed to allow the connection between the dApp and the wallet)
11) [x] QR scanner
12) [ ] improve UI
13) [x] add multiple chain support
14) [ ] (extra) the ability to add other unknown chains manually
15) [ ] (extra) NFT implementation
16) [ ] show other funganble tokens
17) [ ] plutonication deep link
18) [ ] add loading animations
19) [ ] icon and splash screen
20) [ ] implement nicks pallet
21) [ ] show error messages
22) [ ] XCM
23) [ ] credits
24) [ ] more animations
25) [ ] update the color theme
26) [ ] change button names to an icon 

### Other milestones

#### #1 NFTs integration
- show all owned NFTs
- allow minting your own NFTs
- NFT dex implementation

#### #2 Staking
- show stake pools
- show gains
- more...

#### #3 dApp gallery
- dApp promotion page

#### #4 Voting

#### #5 ink!

#### #6 buy crypto
  
### (extra) part 3 - browser extension
Acts like any other browser wallet, 
with the functionality of connecting to 
Web dApps, but instead of storing a private key, 
will generate a QR code for Plutonication. 
It will then pass all the requested data to the PlutoWallet.
