                                     Answer="Our system creates an LLP (which is a Special Purpose Vehicle - a legal entity that owns the property… this is an internationally recognised structure and how a lot of professional real estate investors buy property)… this way just the token holders of a particular property… are the share holders / partners of the LLP so have total control of that property." />
