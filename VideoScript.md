### Talking points
- I have gathered the friends
- Our Plutonication consists of a total of 2 projects
(PlutoWallet, Plutonication package)

### What is PlutoWallet
- PlutoWallet is a sample wallet that implements
Plutonication.

- It has got all the basic functionalities crypto
wallet should have.

- The special thing about the wallet is that it is
multiplatform - from the one code, it works on all
major platforms like Android and iOS.

### What is Plutonication
- plutonication is a standard for a peer2peer
communication between dApps and wallets.
The connection can be crossplatform and works
on all languages.

- it allows the DotSama ecosystem to be utilised
on new and unusual platforms like SmartWatches,
consoles and IOT devices.

- You can download it as a Nuget package or you
can clone the plutonication repo and implement it.

- we have put emphasis on the documentation,
making it clear with examples.
A lot of time was spent making sure that even
junior developers can implement it.

- The detailed explanation on how this works
behind the code is also in the docs.

### Important notes:
- can be used on any platform - even console like switch
- games are very important and being able to use c# in game would be amazing
